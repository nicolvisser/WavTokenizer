Forked and stripped-down version of [WavTokenizer](https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavTokenizer).

Used for **inference only** within workspaces with more recent python (3.12) and torch (2.5.1) versions. By stripping unused code and dependencies, this avoids [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell). This repo depends only on `torch` and `torchaudio`.

Refer to the [original repo](https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavTokenizer) if you need to modify, train or cite the model.
